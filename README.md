# RPG-Modell-Alpha
IN PROGRESS: A Unity RPG (3D) for PC with click to move implementation. Repo used mainly for backup and version control.



Log May 31, 2018: I have updated the assets (mostly the models of houses and other environmental set pieces) and placed them in a folder so that if I can get a collaborator for the art and level design tasks, it is easy for them to locate and place the models.

As of this push, all the models in the current scene are NOT in their final location/orientation/size and have simply been placed for testing purposes.
